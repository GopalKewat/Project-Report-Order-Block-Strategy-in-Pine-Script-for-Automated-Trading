# Project-Report-Order-Block-Strategy-in-Pine-Script-for-Automated-Trading
This project develops a trading strategy based on the concept of order blocks, which are key levels where significant institutional orders are placed. These levels are critical for understanding potential price reversals or continuations. The strategy will be implemented using Pine Script, the language for creating custom indicators and strategies on TradingView.

The aim of the project is to design an automated algorithm for trading stocks and derivatives. The strategy will use the Order Block Indicator to identify these key levels and execute buy and sell orders based on market conditions.
